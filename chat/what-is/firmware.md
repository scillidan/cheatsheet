What is firmware?

```md
Firmware is a type of software that provides low-level control for a device's specific hardware. It consists of the permanent software programmed into a read-only memory (ROM) of the hardware. Unlike regular software applications that are typically updated and changed frequently, firmware is often more stable and tends to remain unchanged during the life of the device.

Firmware serves as the intermediary between the hardware and higher-level software (like the operating system or applications), enabling the device to function properly. It's commonly found in a wide array of devices such as:

- Computers (BIOS or UEFI)
- Routers and networking equipment
- Embedded systems in appliances (washing machines, microwaves)
- Cameras and other electronic devices
- Smartphones

Firmware can often be updated to fix bugs, improve performance, add features, or enhance security. However, these updates might require specific procedures or software tools provided by the device manufacturer.

固件是一种软件，提供对设备特定硬件的低级控制。它由编程到硬件只读存储器（ROM）中的永久软件组成。与通常频繁更新和变化的常规软件应用程序不同，固件通常更稳定，并且在设备的使用寿命内往往保持不变。

固件充当硬件与更高级软件（如操作系统或应用程序）之间的中介，使设备能够正常运作。它通常出现在各种设备中，例如：

- 计算机（BIOS 或 UEFI）
- 路由器和网络设备
- 嵌入式系统的家用电器（洗衣机、微波炉）
- 相机和其他电子设备
- 智能手机

固件通常可以更新，以修复错误、提高性能、添加功能或增强安全性。然而，这些更新可能需要设备制造商提供的特定程序或软件工具。
