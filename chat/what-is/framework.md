What is framework?

```md
A **framework** is a structured platform or set of tools that provides a foundation for developing software applications. It provides a standardized way to build and deploy applications by offering pre-written code, libraries, best practices, and conventions that streamline the development process. Frameworks help developers by reducing the complexity of coding, ensuring greater consistency, and enabling more efficient collaboration.

There are various types of frameworks used across different domains of software development:

1. **Web Frameworks**: These frameworks are designed to facilitate the development of web applications. Examples include:
   - **Django** (Python)
   - **Ruby on Rails** (Ruby)
   - **Angular** (JavaScript)
   - **React** (JavaScript)

2. **Mobile Frameworks**: These frameworks are used for developing mobile applications. Examples include:
   - **Flutter** (Dart)
   - **React Native** (JavaScript)
   - **SwiftUI** (Swift for iOS)

3. **Testing Frameworks**: These provide tools and libraries for writing and executing tests. Examples include:
   - **JUnit** (Java)
   - **pytest** (Python)
   - **Selenium** (for web applications)

4. **Game Development Frameworks**: These are used for creating video games and interactive applications. Examples include:
   - **Unity** (C#)
   - **Unreal Engine** (C++)

5. **Data Science Frameworks**: These aid in data analysis and computational tasks. Examples include:
   - **Pandas** (Python)
   - **TensorFlow** (for machine learning)

### Benefits of Using a Framework:
- **Efficiency**: Developers can save time by using pre-built components rather than writing code from scratch.
- **Consistency**: Frameworks often encourage consistent coding practices, which can improve collaboration among team members.
- **Maintainability**: Well-structured frameworks make it easier to maintain and extend applications.
- **Community Support**: Popular frameworks often have large communities that provide support, documentation, and additional libraries.

Overall, frameworks play a crucial role in modern software development by providing the scaffolding necessary to build robust and scalable applications.
