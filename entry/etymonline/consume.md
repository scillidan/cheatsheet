## consume (v.)

late 14c., "to destroy by separating into parts which cannot be reunited, as by burning or eating," hence "destroy the substance of, annihilate," from Old French _consumer_ "to consume" (12c.) and directly from Latin _consumere_ "to use up, eat, waste," from assimilated form of _com-_, here perhaps an intensive prefix (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com- "Etymology, meaning and definition of com- ")), + _sumere_ "to take," from _sub-_ "under" (see [sub-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sub- "Etymology, meaning and definition of sub- ")) + _emere_ "to buy, take" (from PIE root [\*em-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*em- "Etymology, meaning and definition of *em- ") "to take, distribute").

Specifically, "to destroy by use, wear out by applying to its natural or intended use" from c. 1400. Sense of "to engage the full attention and energy of" is from 1570s.

14世纪晚期，动词 **consume** 意为“通过将物体分解成无法复合的部分（如燃烧或食用）来破坏”，引申为“破坏实质，消灭”，来源于12世纪古法语 _consumer_ “消耗”，直接来源于拉丁语 _consumere_ “用尽，吃掉，浪费”，由同化形式的前缀 _com-_（此处可能为加强意义的前缀，参见 [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com- "Etymology, meaning and definition of com-")）与 _sumere_ “取，用”，_sumere_ 又由 _sub-_ “在……下”（见 [sub-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sub- "Etymology, meaning and definition of sub-")）和 _emere_ “买，取”（源自印欧语根 [\*em-] “取，用，分配”）组成。

特别地，“通过使用而破坏，因使用而磨损”为约1400年开始的含义。“全神贯注，投入全部精力”的含义自1570年代起。
