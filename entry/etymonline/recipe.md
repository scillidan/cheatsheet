## recipe (n.)

1580s, "medical prescription, a formula for the composing of a remedy written by a physician," from French __récipé__ (15c.), from Latin __recipe__ "take!" (this or that ingredient), second person imperative singular of _recipere_ "to hold, contain" (see [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive ")). It was the word written by physicians at the head of prescriptions. Figurative meaning "a prescribed formula" is from 1640s. Meaning "instructions for preparing a particular food" is recorded by 1716. The older sense in English survives chiefly in the pharmacist's abbreviation _**Rx**_.

名词 **recipe** 出现于1580年代，意指“医生开的药方，配制药物的处方公式”，来自法语 __récipé__（15世纪），源自拉丁语命令式形式 __recipe__，意为“取！”，是拉丁语动词 _recipere_（“握住，包含”，参见 [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive")）的第二人称单数祈使式。这是医生在药方开头常用的词。引申义“规定的配方”始于1640年代；用以指“具体食品制作说明”则见于1716年。其古老含义主要保留在药剂师缩写 _Rx_ 中。该词与 [receipt](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receipt "Etymology, meaning and definition of receipt") 意义相近，但有所区别。
