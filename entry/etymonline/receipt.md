## receipt (n.)

late 14c., _receit_, "act of receiving;" also "statement of ingredients in and formula for making a potion or medicine" (compare [_recipe_](https://www.etymonline.com/word/recipe "Etymology, meaning and definition of recipe ")); from Anglo-French or Old North French _receite_ "receipt, _recipe_, prescription" (c. 1300), altered (by influence of _receit_ "he receives," from Vulgar Latin _\*recipit_) from Old French _recete._ This is from Medieval Latin Latin _recepta_ "thing or money received," in classical Latin "received," fem. past participle of _recipere_ "to hold, contain" (see [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive ")).

The classical _\-p-_ began to be restored in the English word after c. 1500, but the pronunciation did not follow. _Conceit_, _deceit_, and _receipt_ all are from Latin _capere_; the _\-p-_ sometimes was restored in all three of them, but it has stuck only in the last. The meaning "written acknowledgment for having received something specified" is from c. 1600.

名词 **receipt**（接收行为）始见于14世纪晚期，拼写为 _receit_，意为“接收的行为”；同时指“制作药剂或药方时所载成分及配方”（可与 [_recipe_](https://www.etymonline.com/word/recipe "Etymology, meaning and definition of recipe") 相比较）。词源来自古安格鲁法语或旧北法语 _receite_，意为“收据，处方”，约始于1300年，受 _receit_（“他接收”，来自野拉丁语 _*recipit_）的影响，将古法语 _recete_ 改写。该词源于中古拉丁语 _recepta_，意为“所接收的物品或款项”，而古典拉丁语中作“已接收”，是拉丁语动词 _recipere_（“握住，包含”，参见 [receive](https://www.etymonline.com/word/receive "Etymology, meaning and definition of receive")）的女性过去分词形式。

约1500年后，英语单词中开始恢复原拉丁语中带有的 _-p-_ 音素，但发音未随之改变。_conceit_、_deceit_ 和 _receipt_ 均源自拉丁语 _capere_，三个词中有时 _-p-_ 音素会被恢复，但最终仅在 _receipt_ 中固定保留。词义为“书面声明确认收到特定物品”始见于约1600年。
